# Recipe Roulette

## Description

### What is Recipe Roulette?

Recipe Roulette' is a random meal generator. Choose a cuisine, click 'Get Random Recipe,' and a recipe will appear in a pop-up with an image and a link to the full recipe. Don't like it? Close the pop-up and try again!

### Technologies used

I used JavaScript because:

- I was able to make use of a flexible data set
- Able to use Math.random() to generate a random recipe from an array
- Easy to handle user interactions

## Inspiration
I drew inspiration from a meme picker I built during the JavaScript module of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

## Future implementations

- Interact with recipe APIs so there's a wider range of recipes
